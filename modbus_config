#WRITE REQUESTS:
#initially the inverter will ask to write something into registers 401-410. I let it and give it a "success" reply.
#it is something along those lines:

#the inverter will then write into registers 401/401 periodically. I just let it and reply success, 
#I don't know that the numbers stand for, but it always seems to be the same two numbers.
